VL CP Logger
=================

This extension just logs more stuff to control panel log (Tools > Logs > Control Panel Log). It logs the following additional actions:

* When entries are created/edited
* When entries are deleted
* When entries are multi-edited
* When templates are edited

If more hooks become available, I can add those actions in too.


Installation
------------

1. Copy the "vl_cp_logger" folder into the "third_party" folder in your ExpressionEngine installation (by default, this is located at "system/expressionengine/third_party").
2. Log in to the control panel and navigate to Add-Ons -> Extensions.
3. Click the "enable" link in the far right of the VL CP Logger row.
